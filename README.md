Efficient computation of relationship matrices for quantitative genetics in Julia.

## Features

- Genomic Relationship Matrix (GRM) calculation
- Pedigree-based relationship matrices (A, A-inverse, kinship, etc.)
- Fast, memory-aware, and parallelized routines
- Designed for large-scale genotype and pedigree data

## Installation

```julia
pkg> add path/to/RelationshipMatrices
```

Or, if registered:

```julia
pkg> add RelationshipMatrices
```

## Usage

```julia
using RelationshipMatrices

# Example: Compute GRM from genotype matrix `gt` and allele frequencies `p`
G = grm(gt, p)

# Or, compute GRM with allele frequencies estimated from `gt`
G = grm(gt)
```

- `gt` should be a `Matrix{Int8}` of size (loci Ã— individuals)
- `p` should be a `Vector{Float64}` of allele frequencies (length = number of loci)

## Functions

- `grm(gt, p)`: Genomic relationship matrix from genotypes and allele frequencies
- `grm(gt)`: GRM with allele frequencies estimated from `gt`
- `ainv(ped)`: Inverse numerator relationship matrix from pedigree
- `kinship(ped)`: Kinship matrix from pedigree
